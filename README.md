The code calculates daily average temperature for historical ERA5 dataset (considered observed), EARTh3-CC SSP585 WBGT for historical and future simulation period. The bias-correction is performed. Further for any desired location(lat,lon), the no of days in a year that desired location will be above a given threshold (35 deg C) is estimated.
